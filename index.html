                <p>SRRNet International Conference 2022
                  For our conference we will travel to the idyllic island of Mauritius where our host will be the Université des Mascareignes. The conference will be organized jointly by the Université des Mascareignes and the Social Responsibility Research Network. After the disruptions of the past couple of years we are looking forward to this event and to joining with you in Mauritius.
                  
                  This conference will be the 20th anniversary of the first ever CSR conference which was held in London and organised by Prof. David Crowther.
                  
                  CSR was defined first as a concept whereby companies would decide voluntarily to contribute to a better society and cleaner environment (European Commission, 2001). Nowadays, CSR has become a priority issue on governments' agendas. The phenomenon of investigation in CSR no longer has an exclusive focus on private owned companies. Global trends have forced both private and public actors to reshape their frameworks, rules, and business models.
                  
                  Some benefits of a public sector CSR include their ability to help inspire new strategies to address gaps in public sector capacity and to promote synergies between the complementary skills of public, private and civil society actors to achieve public policy goals related to sustainable development.</p>
